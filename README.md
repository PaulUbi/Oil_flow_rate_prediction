# Oil_flow_rate_prediction
# Cleaned, transformed, and prepared a dataset comprising 8,740 data points from 24 wells in the Volve oil field, Norway, using Python.
Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models to accurately predict oil flow rate with a 99% accuracy rate. 
-Deployed the machine learning model as a web application using Flask.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask and Sklearn.
